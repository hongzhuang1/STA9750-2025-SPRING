## Does Distance to NYC Impact Real Estate Pricing in Connecticut?

<div class="reveal section" style="font-size: 0.8em;"> 

- Fairfield County, which enjoys the most extensive Metro-North coverage, 
  has seen the highest average appreciation in single-family home values at 
  $169,378 â€” more than double that of Middlesex and Litchfield, and over three 
  times higher than counties like Hartford. 
  
- This disparity underscores how proximity to New York City and access 
  to Metro-North rail service not only influences property value growth but also 
  reflects underlying housing demand.

## The Property Price Effect: Regional Bus Hubs vs. Rail Networks

<div class="reveal section" style="font-size: 0.75em;">

- [CTtransit Data](https://www.cttransit.com/about/developers) shows that Hartford 
  has the highest number of bus stops among Connecticut towns, with 993 stops 
  connecting to 69 other towns.

- In contrast, New Haven offers direct access to the Metro-North rail line, with 
  approximately 62.69% of its properties enjoying convenient proximity to the 
  service-defined as a travel time of just 3 to 5 minutes by car to the nearest
  station. 
  
- These contrasting transit dynamics are clearly mirrored in property values. Across 
  multiple property types, New Haven consistently commands higher prices than 
  Hartford: on average, single-family homes are 41.63% more expensive, 
  three-family homes are 32.81% higher, and two-family homes command a 17.63% premium.
  These patterns suggest that access to commuter rail significantly amplifies 
  real estate demand and pricing power.

## Model Performance & Future Work

<div class="reveal section" style="font-size: 0.75em;">

- The three predictors together explain 35% variation in real estate pricing in
  Connecticut. Due to the limitations in obtaining accurate property types for 
  the missing values and the imputation difficulty, the model performance would 
  be improved if the two challenges are resolved.
